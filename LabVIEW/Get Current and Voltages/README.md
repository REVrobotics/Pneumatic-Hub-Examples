# Get Current and Voltage

## Description

This example shows how to get the various current and voltage readings from the PH.

## Usage

Things to check:

* The team number in the project target matches your roboRIO's team number.

Steps:

1. Deploy the code to your roboRIO with the PH connected.
2. Open _Periodic Tasks.vi_, on the front panel, you should see input voltage, solenoid current and voltage, compressor current, analog voltages.
